Components

- Deck of character cards, each card has a movement pattern, an attack pattern, attack value, hitpoints value and may have an ability
- A board, where the player will place their defenses in the position they want

Setup

- Each player chooses their 3 warriors
- The orb will be put in the middle row of the penultimate column for each team
- Before the match, the players will receive 5 random pattern cards and choose 2, that'll be revealed after both picked them up
- After choosing the pattern card, the players will put 2 barricades
- After setting the board, the players will place their warriors on the board
- When the match starts, both boards will connect with two lines of neutral territory between them
- The first player is defined and plays with one warrior, as the second player plays with two in the first turn

Rules

- Each turn, the current player can perform with a warrior or turn to the other side
- Performing can be one or more of those, in any order: move, attack and use their ability
- Turning consumes the whole action of that warrior, unless said otherwise
- When attacked, the card's hitpoints are reduced by the attack value of the attacker
- When an orb receives an attack, the attacker team wins
- After using an ability, it can't be used the next turn
- Unless defined otherwise by an ability, a card can't move or attack past an enemy card or a barricade
- The pattern cards picked at the start of the game can be used ONE time only each, with ANY card, for either attack or movement
- When the turn ends, the warrior is marked as "used" and can only be used in the next round
- After every warrior is played, the round is over and all warriors are available again
